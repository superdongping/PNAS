% "Main_EEG_Plot_with_SWD_number.m" is the main program to plot the raw EEG recording traces and count the SWD number in the absence seizure mouse models.
% The representative figures Fig 1C-F, Fig 3G-H is plotted by this program.

% "Main_EEG_video_plot.m" is the main program to analyze the videos from the EEG recording.
