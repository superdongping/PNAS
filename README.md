% These are the codes used to plot, analyze the EEG data and locomotor behavior for a mouse model which has absence seizure and motor disorder.
% These codes are written for the MATLAB, tested under MATLAB 2018a version.

% "Main_EEG_Plot_with_SWD_number.m" is the main program to plot the raw EEG recording traces and count the SWD number in the absence seizure mouse models.
% The representative figures Fig 1C-F, Fig 3G-H is plotted by this program.

% "Main_EEG_video_plot.m" is the main program to analyze the videos from the EEG recording.
% The analysis of total movement in the Fig 1C, Fig 3G and Fig S2 are done by this program.

% "Main_open_field_trace.m" is the main program to plot the open field traces and quantify the total distance traveled during 15 min open field test.
% The representative figures Fig 4A-B, Fig 6F is plotted by this program.
% This tracing method is based on the subtraction of the image from the video which contain the mouse with the background (without mice).
% Please note that the open field box is white and the fur of the mouse is black, which is darker than the background.
